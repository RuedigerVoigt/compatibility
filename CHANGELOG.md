# Changelog compatibility Python library

## Version 0.9.0 stable (2021-03-21)

* Change development status from `beta` to `stable`.
* The parameter `release_date` now also accepts a string in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` besides a datetime object.

## Version 0.8.0 beta (2020-01-18)

* Initial public release. Chose a high version number to indicate it is almost feature complete and has a high test coverage.
